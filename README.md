JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures
========================================

This is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript. The code isn't overly-optimized but is written to be correct and readable. The algorithms and data structures are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.
